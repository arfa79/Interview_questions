8.what is telnet and how can i use it? 
Telnet is a network protocol and a command-line tool used for remote communication with other 
computers and devices over a network, typically the internet or a local area network (LAN).
It allows you to establish text-based, interactive communication with a remote host or device.
Telnet was widely used in the past for remote administration and accessing network services, 
but its usage has decreased due to security concerns, as it transmits data, including login 
credentials, in an unencrypted and insecure manner.
telnet 192.168.1.100 23
9.if we try to telnet to server that has 502 error in browser what is happening ?
Debugging and Troubleshooting: Using Telnet in such a scenario can be a debugging or 
diagnostic tool to inspect how the server is responding or to troubleshoot network connectivity 
issues. You might use it to gather information that can help identify the root cause 
of the "502 Bad Gateway" error, but it won't directly resolve the HTTP error itself.
10. if i run the docker stop command a container still continues to its work what is the type of that?
thats is a dbus-daemon demon . The dbus-daemon is typically a system-level service running
 on the host operating system, and stopping a Docker container will not impact its operation
11. what is cmd and if we have 5 cmd wich one is running first? 
You specify the command to run when the container is started. This can be the default command that
 runs when the container starts or an entry point script
12. what is entry point ? on a Dockerfile, the ENTRYPOINT instruction specifies the command
that will be executed when a Docker container based on that image is started. It defines the
primary command that the container will run, and it can also include command-line arguments
13. what is CI/CD ? continues integration / continues delivery 
14. what is gitlab-runer ? and how we use that ? what is the name of the config file ?

16. what is proxy pass ?The proxy_pass directive in Nginx is used to set up reverse proxying.
It passes client requests to a specified server or group of servers, making Nginx
act as an intermediary or a reverse proxy server. This is commonly used for load balancing 
and serving content from backend servers
17. what is the diffrence of pass proxy and proxy server ? threre is no diffrence betweeen theses .
and just that doesn't modify or cache the data passing through it
18.what is 502 error and what should i check ? A "502 Bad Gateway" error typically occurs when
 a web server acting as a gateway or proxy is unable to get a valid response from an upstream server,
 which is usually another web server or application server.
