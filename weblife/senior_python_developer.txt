OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code1. OOP provides some concepts to simplify software development and maintenance, such as:

Class: A user-defined data type that represents a set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.
Object: An instance of a class that has an identity, state, and behavior.
Inheritance: When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
Polymorphism: When one task is performed in different ways by different objects.
Abstraction: Hiding internal details and showing functionality.
Encapsulation: Binding code and data together into a single unit.

One way to bind data and methods together is by using a class. A class is a user-defined data type that can have attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. For example, in Python, we can create a class called Person that has attributes like name and age, and methods like greet and birthday. Here is a code snippet that shows how to define and use the class:

Python

# Define the class
class Person:
    # Initialize the object with name and age
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    # Define a method to greet someone
    def greet(self, other):
        print(f"Hello, {other}. I am {self.name}.")
    
    # Define a method to celebrate birthday
    def birthday(self):
        self.age += 1
        print(f"Happy birthday to me! I am {self.age} years old.")

# Create an object of the class
p1 = Person("Alice", 20)

# Access the attributes
print(p1.name) # Alice
print(p1.age) # 20

# Call the methods
p1.greet("Bob") # Hello, Bob. I am Alice.
p1.birthday() # Happy birthday to me! I am 21 years old.

This is an example of encapsulation, where the data and methods of the Person class are bound together and hidden from the outside world. We can only access them through the object p1, using the dot notation. We donâ€™t need to know how the methods are implemented internally, we just need to know what they do and how to use them. This is also an example of abstraction, where we can use the same interface (the class) for different objects (different instances of the class) that have different data and behavior.

Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with your question. ðŸ˜Š

Web crawling is a technique to collect data from the web by finding and downloading web pages that contain the information you want. For example, if you want to crawl a shop website for product ids, you need to find the URLs of the pages that have the product listings, download the HTML of those pages, and extract the product ids from the HTML.

There are different ways to build a web crawler in Python, one of the most popular programming languages for web scraping. You can use standard libraries like urllib and html.parser, or you can use third-party libraries like Requests and Beautiful Soup, which may provide a better developer experience. You can also use a web crawling framework like Scrapy, which handles a lot of the common functionality that all scrapers need, such as concurrency, data extraction, and data storage.

If you want to crawl the shop website in parallel, meaning that you can download and process multiple pages at the same time, you need to use some kind of concurrency mechanism, such as threads, processes, or asynchronous programming. Scrapy has built-in support for concurrency, so you can easily configure the number of concurrent requests and the delay between requests. Other libraries may require more manual work to implement concurrency.
