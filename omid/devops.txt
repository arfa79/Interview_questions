==================== technical Interview ===========
1. Imagine you're working on a Linux server, and you need to search for and replace a specific 
string within a file. Without using traditional text editors like nano or vim, how would you 
approach this task using a command-line tool? Please describe the steps you would take and the 
command you would use, providing details on any flags or options necessary for the task.
= answer : 
To search and replace a specific string within a file in the Linux terminal without using nano 
or Vim, I would use the sed command. I'd employ the substitution command, s/old_string/new_string/,
and the -i flag for in-place editing. This allows me to directly modify the file. For instance, 
the command might look like sed -i 's/apple/orange/' filename to replace 'apple' with 'orange' 
in the specified file.
2. are you familiar with docker? yes
3. do you know how we can access external services and use them? ingress and nginx
4. what are namespaces in Kubernetes? I used that for making a group for my ArgoCD and making it separate
from my default but You can specify a namespace in the metadata of your Kubernetes resources, such as
 pods, services, or deployments, to indicate which namespace they belong to.
5. what is helm? I used Helm as a package manager for installing charts
6. are you familiar with CI/CD tools? yes like ArgoCD I can change my Kubernetes cluster and it sees it and
saves stages in GitLab 
7. what are ingress files and types? In Kubernetes, Ingress is an API object defining how external
 HTTP/S traffic should be routed to services. It's configured using YAML files. There are various 
 types of Ingress, including Simple Fanout (routing based on hostnames), Name-based Virtual 
 Hosting (fine-grained control over routing), TLS Termination (for HTTPS), Path-based Routing,
 and Rewrite (modifying requested URLs). Understanding and configuring Ingress is essential for 
 managing external access to services in a Kubernetes cluster.
